GROUP CHAT ORCHESTRATION  HISTORY
Assistant: Thank you for outlining the key features for the online grocery ordering system. To ensure we build a solution that fully meets your expectations, I’d like to clarify and expand on the business requirements. Below are some points and questions to consider:

### 1. Product Catalog & Inventory Management
- Will the system need to integrate with existing inventory systems or suppliers for real-time stock updates?
- Are there any categories or specific product types to prioritize (e.g., perishables, frozen foods)?
- Should the system support product substitutions if an item is out of stock?

### 2. User Accounts & Profiles
- Will users be required to create an account to place orders, or will guest checkout be allowed?
- Should users be able to save multiple delivery addresses?
- Will there be user profiles managing preferences, order history, and payment methods?

### 3. Same-Day Delivery
- What cut-off time defines eligibility for same-day delivery?
- Are there geographic delivery zones or restrictions to consider?
- Will delivery slots be selectable by the customer, and should the system handle delivery capacity to avoid overbooking?

### 4. Payment & Security
- What payment methods should be supported (credit/debit cards, digital wallets, COD)?
- Are there specific compliance or security standards required (e.g., PCI DSS)?
- Should the system support fraud detection or other payment security measures?

### 5. Order Tracking

- Should notifications be sent via email, SMS, or push notifications?
- Will there be integration with third-party delivery services or a proprietary delivery fleet?

### 6. Promo Codes & Discounts
- What types of promotions should be supported (percentage off, fixed amount, buy-one-get-one, free delivery)?
- Are promo codes single-use or multi-use? Are there expiration dates or usage limits?
- Should promotions apply automatically based on cart contents or require manual entry?

### 7. Additional Features & Considerations
- Should the system support subscription or recurring orders?
- Are there reporting or analytics requirements for orders, customer behavior, or inventory?
- Do you anticipate needing multilingual or multi-currency support?
- Will there be any integration with marketing, CRM, or customer support platforms?
