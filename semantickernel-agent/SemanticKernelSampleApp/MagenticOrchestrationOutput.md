ðŸ“œ ORCHESTRATION HISTORY
[Assistant] SupplierIntelAgent: Assessment of Disruption:
- The typhoon in Taiwan has caused a complete halt in shipments from the key supplier.
- Based on the latest meteorological forecasts, the typhoon is expected to impact the region severely for the next 3-5 days, with recovery and reopening of logistics possibly taking an additional 2-3 days.
- Local reports indicate potential power outages and transportation infrastructure damage, which may further delay shipment resumption.

Fallback Suppliers:
- Identify alternative suppliers in nearby regions with similar capability and capacity, such as suppliers in South Korea, Japan, or Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Thailand).
- Evaluate current inventory levels and lead times from these fallback suppliers to ensure timely substitution.
- Prioritize suppliers with existing contracts or previous engagement to minimize qualification and onboarding time.

Revised Production Logistics:
- Adjust production schedules to utilize available inventory and prioritize product lines less dependent on the affected supplier.
- Initiate expedited orders from fallback suppliers.
- Coordinate with logistics partners to reroute shipments from alternative sources, considering air freight to mitigate time lost due to sea/land delays.
- Monitor the situation continuously for updates on Taiwanâ€™s recovery progress to reintegrate the key supplier once stable.

Next Steps:
- Confirm current inventory and safety stock levels.
- Reach out to identified fallback suppliers for availability and lead times.
- Align with production planning and logistics teams for schedule revisions and shipment rerouting.

Production & Logistics Plan:
- Shift urgent orders to Supplier A and D for fastest response.
- Increase air freight usage temporarily from fallback suppliers to reduce delays.
- Adjust production workload to prioritize products stocked with existing inventory.
- Regularly monitor Taiwan supplier status to revert once normal operations resume.
